Hi, 
I'm Soichiro Ono ;) Nice to see you guys!

This is for Japanese student in University of Maryland Global Campus who want to see my code in computer science. 

So, take it easy and maybe you can copy that lol.

Week1:
In the disscussion, just install the Java and output Hello UMUC on command promt. And do test. It is quite easy so far. 
Sorry for not having the copy of first assignment. I forgot to do it. In the next week,I'll copy that and put the file in it.
